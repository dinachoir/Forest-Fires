# Forest-Fires
This project aims to predict the occurrence and the burned area of forest fires in the northeast region of Portugal based on the spatial, temporal, and weather variables. This prediction can be used for detecting and preventing the occurrence of forest fires early before it can be happened and calculating the forces sent to the incident and deciding the urgency of the situation.
